## Installation ##

### Python (Terminal) ###

If you're using macOS or Windows, please install a python interpreter (for example
<https://www.python.org/downloads/> or <https://thonny.org/>)

Download the latest version of LearningSoftwareTerminal.py and run it for the first time.
It will automatically create the necessary folders for you. You can delete the Test.json
in the Packages folder and installing your own packages by downloading and saving them in
the Packages folder. 

If you prefer a language other than english, you can download a translation, save it
in the Languages folder and typing !language [name]

Please make sure that JavaScript is enabled and you're using a modern web browser.

\* No third party packages, no other languages than english, no automatic answer check,
no saving of settings and no creation of stats.

## Contribution ##

 - Code: You can create a pull request with your new features, bug fixes and other 
   improvements you've coded.
 - Sharing stats* : You can send your encrypted stats.json.enc file (in Userdata) to me.
   The stats file includes answers, technical data about your computer/python version and
   usage statistics.
 - Create packages: You can create a package with exercises you've created.
 - Create translations* : You can translate the EN.json file to help people that 
   can't understand english

## Updates ##

### Python (Terminal) ###

If no other instructions are given, just replace the old LearningSoftwareTerminal.py file with the new one.

### HTML ###

If no other instructions are given, just replace the old LearningSoftware.html file with the new one.

## Update Schedule ##

There is no regular update schedule. Updates are published directly after they pass the testing phase.
The HTML edition is usually updated later than the Python edition.

## Privacy ##

The python edition automatically collects data about your usage, answers and technical equipment.
The collected data isn't automatically sent to me (github.com/Emil105105), you have to manually send it 
(if you want to support this project). The collected data will not be shared with any third partys (except 
for anonymous data that was collected from all users, such as the most popular OS of all users)
